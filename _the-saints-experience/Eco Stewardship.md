<h2><strong>SAINTS’ ECO-STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMME</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Vision: To Nurture Future-Ready Green Stewards of the Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>The Saints’ Eco-Stewardship Programme aims to nurture generations of Singaporeans
with&nbsp;<strong>informed</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>responsible</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>sustainability-conscious mindsets and habits&nbsp;</strong>from
young.</p>
<p>Channel our youth’s interest in the environment towards having a sense
of hope and&nbsp;<strong>taking constructive action</strong>, undergirded
by&nbsp;<strong>sound values and knowledge</strong>, and a sensitivity
towards the Singapore context.</p>

<p>The Saints Eco-Stewardship Programme is an ongoing initiative at our school
that educates students and the community about environmental protection
and public health, aligned with the MOE eco-stewardship framework. This
year, we have integrated learning experiences across curriculum, community,
campus, and culture, with a focus on hands-on learning and community outreach.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting a ‘Green’ Culture and through Community Outreach</strong>
</p>
<p>The Green Envoys, a group of student environmental advocates, launched
a used-angpow-packet recycling drive post-Chinese New Year, sparking a
school-wide recycling competition that ignited a culture of recycling.
They also led sustainability-related VIA projects, including a textiles
recycling drive that collected 18 kg of clothes in collaboration with Green
Sproutz. An enhanced plastic-collection collaboration with Sembwaste introduced
a tonnage challenge, with Secondary 1 students promoting the 3Rs and engaging
about 150 elderly from Calvary Community Care, Viriya Family Services and
Kwong Wai Shiu Eldercare during our school community outreach day, Saints
Care Day. All secondary 2 students also played their part by advocating
for edible gardening, dengue prevention, and clean toilets.</p>

<p><strong>Silver Award at the Eco-Schools Awards 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>We are proud to have achieved the Silver Award in the Eco-Schools Awards
Competition 2024, a testament to our school's commitment to sustainability
and environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>In recognition of this achievement, we were honored to be invited to the
Eco-Schools Awards Presentation at the Sustainable Singapore Gallery. There,
we had the opportunity to share our experiences and highlight the importance
of a whole-school approach in fostering a strong culture of eco-stewardship
within our community.</p>
<p>This achievement reflects the dedication of our students, staff, and partners
in making sustainability a way of life. Let us continue striving towards
a greener future!</p>

</p>
<p>The Green Envoys also improved the aquaponics setup this year, creating
larger spaces for fish and enhancing nutrient cycling for healthy plant
growth. This setup has facilitated authentic science lessons, and we are
proud to be able to share our experiences with Minister Chan during his
visit this year.</p>

<p><strong>Therapeutic Garden</strong>
</p>
<p>The Therapeutic Garden at St. Andrew’s Secondary School stands as a meaningful
addition to our school environment, transforming an empty plot of land
beside our heritage building, Woodsville House, into a space that nurtures
both the mind and the love for learning. The journey of building this garden
began in 2024. After months of planning and discussions, construction began
in late 2024, and by March 2025, the Therapeutic Garden was finally completed.
This project would not have been possible without the dedication and hard
work of our alumnus Mr Ganesh and our Green Envoys who contributed to beautify
the garden. As we step into this beautiful space, may it serve as a reminder
of our collective efforts in creating a learning environment that inspires
curiosity, well-being, and a deeper appreciation for nature.</p>

<p><strong>Go Green SG 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Aligned with Go Green SG’s Year of Public Health Campaign, our community
outreach efforts have gained the support of the Ministry of Sustainability
and Environment. During a community clean-up session with Senior Parliamentary
Secretary Mr. Baey Yam Keng, students emphasized the importance of a zero-litter
environment, clean toilets, water conservation, and the 3Rs. The event,
which collected over 12 kg of litter, sent a strong visual message about
environmental sustainability to the community, further reinforcing our
school’s commitment to conservation.</p>

<p><strong>Project Greenshift: A Journey of Eco-Stewardship and Innovation</strong>
</p>
<p>What began as a small initiative by a group of passionate Secondary 2
students has evolved into a school-wide movement, driving meaningful environmental
change within our community. Over the past two years, these students from
the Solomon’s Circle and Prefectorial Board have demonstrated remarkable
dedication to eco-stewardship, continuously expanding their efforts to
make a lasting impact.</p>
<p>We are proud to celebrate their outstanding achievement—Project Greenshift
has secured 3rd place at the Future Problem Solving National Finals, held
at Raffles Girls' School on 21st February 2025. Their innovative approach
to sustainability has earned them a prestigious invitation to compete at
the World Finals at Indiana University, Bloomington.</p>
