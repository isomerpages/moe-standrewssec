We started the implementation of full subject based banding (FSBB) in 2018, which has enabled students posted to the N(A) and N(T) courses to take subject(s) at a higher academic level starting from Secondary one. Students are empowered to further develop their strengths in subjects they have performed well in at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).

Over the course of two years, we have received heartening feedback from teachers, students and parents about FSBB, including: the forging of wider friendship circles as a result of mixed class groupings; nurturing a stronger culture of peer support; and building grit as well as self-esteem in our boys.

Students who have done consistently well in their FSBB subjects also appreciated being offered the option to laterally transfer to a more demanding course (i.e. from N(T) course to the N(A) course, or from the N(A) course to the Express course). They include Secondary 2 students, Andre Ramraj Manalili Khurana and Ebner Dheeren Joshua, who have laterally transferred to the Express course at the end of 2018.Â
