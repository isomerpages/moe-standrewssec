## Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)

  
The CCE Department drives and supports the school’s strategic thrust- Serving and Belonging by providing saints with opportunities to social emotional learning through a comprehensive structured formal and co-curricular programme. In alignment with our school mission, it is our belief to develop Saints in character and in discipline so that they can be servant leaders who bring life to the nations.
