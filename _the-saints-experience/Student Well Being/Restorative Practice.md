## Restorative Practice 

### Discipline Policy

It is the School's responsibility to provide an all-rounded general as well as Christian education for every child who comes into our care. Every child has the right to expect an environment that is conducive to learning and is free of disruption. Likewise, every student has the responsibility to contribute to that safe learning environment. 

  

### Our Approach To Discipline - Restorative Practices

Restorative Practices aims to inculcate self-discipline in pupils and has elements of supporting, teaching, exercising and re-directing which are advocated in the Discipline Framework. 

  

Restorative Practices is a victim-centred response to offences that provides opportunities for those more directly affected by the offence – the victim, offender, their families, representatives of the school and community – to be directly involved in responding to the harm caused by the offence. Restorative Practices is characterised by four key values: encounter, amend, reintegration and inclusion. These values emphasise the importance of providing opportunities for active involvement of those affected: offering support and assistance to offence victims; holding offenders directly accountable to the people and communities they have violated; restoring the emotional and material losses to the victims (to the degree it is possible); providing a range of opportunities for dialogue and problem solving among interested offence victims, offenders, families, and other support persons; and offering offenders opportunities for competency development and reintegration into productive life. 

  

In the process of resolving the conflict, the offenders are asked to suggest the appropriate consequences for their action, which may include any form of punishment. However, any students who fail to cooperate with the teacher will be dealt with differently.
