## Restorative Practice 

### **Discipline Policy**

In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline in our school, there are three aspects to be considered. We must promote a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care in order to prevent challenging behaviours from occurring. Inappropriate behaviour must be addressed promptly and corrected before it affects students’ development and well-being. Finally, we must replace inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones and restore relationships with others hurt by their actions.

  

### **Our Approach To Discipline - Restorative Practices**

Restorative Practice (RP) is a whole school teaching and learning approach that encourages behaviour that is supportive and respectful. It puts the onus on individuals to be truly accountable for their behaviour and to repair any harm caused to others as a result of their actions. The focus is on resolving conflict, repairing harm, and healing relationships so that the student can be well reintegrated back to his community.

  
##### **The five pillars of Restorative Practice are:**

*   Build healthy relationships between educators and students
*   Reduce, prevent and improve harmful behaviour
*   Repair harm and restore positive relationships
*   Resolve conflict, hold individuals and groups accountable
*   Inspires proactive discussions on the needs of the school community  

RP is a positive discipline approach that engages the students in their corrective process. Conflict is an inevitable part of life, hence schools need to be safe places where young people can learn and thrive in a supportive and caring environment. A restorative approach focuses on building positive relationships across the whole school community. It aims to create an ethos of respect, inclusion, cooperation and responsibility.  
  

When schools are restorative, they:

*   value and model empathy and respectful relationships
*   value student voice and utilise collaborative problem solving
*   view inappropriate behaviours as opportunities for learning
*   apply procedural fairness
*   recognise the importance of repairing damaged relationships
*   separate the ‘deed’ from the ‘doer’
*   use active listening and positive language and tone
*   foster self-awareness and self-management in the student
*   implement consequences that are proportional and fair with respect to the School Rules
*   remain future focused for students’ growth and development

  
We aspire for our Saints to be accountable for their behaviour as men of grace and polish, who can lead themselves well so as to be Servant Leaders in their communities. We are thankful for the strong partnership with parents to groom our Saints together.
