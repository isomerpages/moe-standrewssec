<h4>Food and Consumer Education (Lower Sec)/ Nutrition and Food Science (Upper Sec)</h4>
<p>The Food and Consumer Education (FCE) and Nutrition and Food Science (NFS)
curriculum equip students with essential life skills for healthy and independent
living. In FCE, students learn about nutrition, food choices, and responsible
resource management.</p>
<p>In NFS, they deepen their understanding of nutrition and food science
through practical investigations and recipe planning. Students apply scientific
principles in food preparation, develop problem-solving and critical thinking
skills, and learn to make informed decisions that support lifelong health
and well-being.</p>

<h4>Music Education</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that every Saint possesses innate musical qualities that could
be developed. Here at St Andrew’s, we offer them varied opportunities to
discover their interests and strengths through a variety of musicking activities
and expression of thoughts and emotions. Through our Higher Music, O-Level,&nbsp;
‘N(T)-Level and Lower Secondary Music programmes, we aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Expose the boys to a wide range of genres and styles to deepen their understanding
of cultural diversity of music in Singapore and the world,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nurture confident Saints who are able to listen, sing, play and create
music, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop good values, character and social-emotional well-being so that
they are ready for the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Teaching &amp; Learning of Music, we adopt MOE’s Key Music Pedagogical
Principles in the design of our lessons to facilitate students’ learning
to achieve the intended outcomes of the syllabus. These principles include:
Experience, Concept Application. We create meaningful musical experiences
where the boys engage personally with music and are later able to draw
musical understandings from those experiences. Thereafter, the boys get
to practise the learnt concepts through applying and expressing the ideas,
creating and experimenting.</p>
