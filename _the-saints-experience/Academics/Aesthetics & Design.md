## **ART**

#### General Art Programme for Lower Secondary

The curriculum aims to cultivate visual literacy and an appreciation for art and design.

A visually literate student will be able to observe, understand and make meaning of the world he is in. He will also be able to communicate his ideas through visuals.

A student who appreciates art will be able to recognise the relevance of art and find art valuable in his life.

## **Music Education**

We believe that every Saint possesses innate musical qualities that could be developed. Here at St Andrew’s, we offer them varied opportunities to discover their interests and strengths through a variety of musicking activities and expression of thoughts and emotions. Through our Higher Music, O-Level,&nbsp; ‘N(T)-Level and Lower Secondary Music programmes, we aim to:

  

*   Expose the boys to a wide range of genres and styles to deepen their understanding of cultural diversity of music in Singapore and the world,&nbsp;
    
*   Nurture confident Saints who are able to listen, sing, play and create music, and
    
*   Develop good values, character and social-emotional well-being so that they are ready for the future.
    
  
In the Teaching &amp; Learning of Music, we adopt MOE’s Key Music Pedagogical Principles in the design of our lessons to facilitate students’ learning to achieve the intended outcomes of the syllabus. These principles include: Experience, Concept Application. We create meaningful musical experiences where the boys engage personally with music and are later able to draw musical understandings from those experiences. Thereafter, the boys get to practise the learnt concepts through applying and expressing the ideas, creating and experimenting.
