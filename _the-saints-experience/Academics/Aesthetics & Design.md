## Aesthetics & Design

**The Aesthetics and Design Department offers Art, Design & Technology (D&T), Food and Consumer Education (FCE) and Music at lower and upper secondary levels.**

General Art Programme for Lower Secondary
-----------------------------------------

The curriculum aims to cultivate visual literacy and an appreciation for art and design.  


A visually literate student will be able to observe, understand and make meaning of the world he is in. He will also be able to communicate his ideas through visuals. 
  

A student who appreciates art will be able to recognise the relevance of art and find art valuable in his live.

# **Food and Consumer Education (Lower Sec)**


###### The Food and Consumer Education Unit aims to enrich students’ experience in equipping themselves with the basic skills for independent living through the principles of nutrition, food management, and consumer education. Programmes include:

#### Cooking Assessment

Practical cooking assessments are conducted during lessons for all lower secondary students. This is a good channel of assessment where students are assessed on their cooking skills. This is a student-centered lesson as students learn by exploring ways on how to meet their task questions. They also learn about the importance of good hygiene in the kitchen, simple housekeeping procedures and also time management skills.

#### Coursework Modules 

Students will need to go through weeks of research, planning and decision making before proceeding to buy the necessary ingredients that they have planned to cook a meal based on an assigned case study (e.g. for a person with diabetes). The cooking is assessed during their practical lessons.

#### Integrated Project Work
To instill the joy of learning of FCE  in our Secondary 1 students, we designed an integrated project work as part of the curriculum for the boys. From planning and baking to plating and presentation, the boys learnt about the nutritious values of ingredients that can be put together in a cupcake and can still taste and look good! Given a problem task at the start, the boys get to collaborate in pairs to design their cupcakes and eventually take photographs of their bakes using the concept of angles and lighting. Their works are viewed by the teachers and school leaders and the top three winners of the food photography competition would receive prizes for their good work.

### Sustainability Project 

To make the chapters in the textbooks come alive, the FCE/NFS unit  designed a project that aims to encourage students to upcycle ready/ used materials in innovative ways. Students are tasked to use discarded materials and make them into aesthetically pleasing items. Students are given the flexibility to research and decide on an item that they intend to create. Some items that the students have created are wall mirror decoration, flower vase and pencil holders.

## **Nutrition and Food Science (Upper sec)**

**The design of the NFS syllabus is guided by the NFS Education Framework:**
![](/images/Academics/Capture.png)

The upper secondary NFS curriculum focuses largely on applying principles of culinary science creatively in food preparation and cooking. This will prepare them to handle the coursework component of the national examinations. 


Coursework should be completed for assessment by the end of July or early August of the examination year. The assignment requires a problem-solving and investigative approach, with an emphasis on investigation work. A total of 25 hours of curriculum time will be assigned to discuss, facilitate and carry out the investigation and practical work as required. 

They also learn to appreciate the importance of using a variety of food commodities in food management and the issues of food security, including food safety and sustainable food consumption. In this way, they will be able to advocate nutrition and health for self, family and the community.

#### **Enrichment Course** 

To further supplement the NFS curriculum, the Secondary 3 Nutrition and Food Science Students attend a yearly enrichment workshop that prepares them for the ‘Exploratory Study’ component of their coursework. In this 2-day workshop conducted by an external culinary expert, students learn how to  conduct fair, accurate food experiments and carry out sensory evaluation. They also get to practise culinary skills such as baking, frying, steaming, and piping of the fillings into the tart.

## **Music Education**

We believe that every Saint possesses innate musical qualities that could be developed. Here at St Andrew’s Secondary, we offer them varied opportunities to discover their interests and strengths through a variety of musicking activities and expression of thoughts and emotions. Through our Higher Music, O-Level,  ‘N(T)-Level and Lower Secondary Music programmes, we aim to:

  

*   Expose the boys to a wide range of genres and styles to deepen their understanding of cultural diversity of music in Singapore and the world, 
    
*   Nurture confident Saints who are able to listen, sing, play and create music, and
    
*   Develop good values, character and social-emotional well-being so that they are ready for the future.
    
  
In the Teaching & Learning of Music, we adopt MOE’s Key Music Pedagogical Principles in the design of our lessons to facilitate students’ learning to achieve the intended outcomes of the syllabus. These principles include: Experience, Concept Application. We create meaningful musical experiences where the boys engage personally with music and are later able to draw musical understandings from those experiences. Thereafter, the boys get to practise the learnt concepts through applying and expressing the ideas, creating and experimenting.
