## Learning For Life Programme 

Our LLP aims to develop WISE & TRUE values within Saints to serve family, society and eternity; and ambassadors of healthy living who will bring life to the nations.

  

Rugby is a nexus for all students in SASS. We leverage on Rugby as a vehicle to develop life skills within the boys to serve the society. It also uses myriad Sports – Rugby, in particular – to encourage an active lifestyle in school and society.

  

As part of the programme, our student athletes undergo holistic coaching and serve as ambassadors of active lifestyle and healthy living. They train under the expert guidance of professional coaches, who coach across the SA family of schools. Academic support and mentoring is provided to student athletes to ensure they excel in school as a whole.
