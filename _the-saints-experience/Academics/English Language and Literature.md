<h2>English Language and Literature</h2>
<h4>Our Vision</h4>
<p><strong>Servant Leaders who think critically, communicate effectively, and lead with empathy and integrity.</strong>
</p>
<p>Taking reference from the EL Syllabus 2020, the teaching and learning
of EL would enable students to be:</p>

</div>
<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>To meet the language-learning needs of young men in the 21st Century by
developing life-long learners who are confident and able users of the English
language. As concerned citizens and active contributors, they will become:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>creative (yet structured) writers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>confident (yet sensitive) speakers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>careful (yet curious) listeners; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>critical (yet open) readers and viewers.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>EL Curricular Approach</h4>
<p>Aligned with the four areas of language learning stipulated in the EL
Syllabus 2020, the approach at SAS(S) develops Saints who are effective
in each domain as shown:</p>

</div>
<p>The SAS(S) approach is informed by the belief that students learn best
when they are aware of how they learn. The A-F Framework presents the rigour
that undergirds the Saints EL experience:</p>

<h4>Saints Read Programme</h4>
<p>A cornerstone of the SAS(S) English curriculum, the Saints Read Programme
nurtures discerning, informed, and reflective learners. Run during EL lessons,
the programme engages students in topics of relevance. Students respond
by producing artefacts of various modes such as journal writing, sharing
reflections on Padlet, or delivering speeches. The process harnesses students’
interest in different topics, broadens their perspective, and invites them
to delve into rich discourse on complex issues.</p>
<h3>Literature</h3>
<p>Through the study of Literature, we hope to inculcate in our boys a respect
for the importance of reading widely and deeply, and to develop their ability
to appreciate their ability to appreciate the subtle nuances that texts
carry.</p>
<p>As teachers of English Literature, we believe in acting as role models
displaying love for the creative play of language found in literary texts.
We hope to open our students' eyes to the value of reading as an experience
that enhances our understanding of others and ourselves.</p>
<p>Our Literature lessons are designed around two areas of focus:</p>
<p><strong>5 Areas of Study in Literature</strong>
