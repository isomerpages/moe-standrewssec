We aim to design a model English Language programme tailor-made to meet the language-learning and usage needs of young men in the 21st Century where they are constantly bombarded with messages across the different media.  

  

Our mission is to develop life-long learners who are confident and able users of the English Language. Through this mastery of the language, our students will become:

*   Creative (yet structured) writers; 
*   Confident (yet sensitive) speakers; 
*   Careful (yet curious) listeners; and 
*   Critical (yet open) readers and viewers.  

  

As concerned citizens and active contributors, our students will be able to express their ideas articulately and convincingly.

  

### Programmes

Our English lessons are designed around two key features:

*   Journal
*   Explicit Teaching of Grammar: Our students will receive instruction in the fundamental concepts of Grammar that will contribute to their mastery of English. 

  

As far as possible, the boys are provided with authentic learning experiences where they will be involved in applying the language skills learnt to meaningful projects by harnessing the power of ICT. 

  

These lessons are supported by the following approaches:

  

● Whole School: Reading & Media Literacy 

● Whole School: Journal writing

● Sec 2: Food Trail

● Sec 3: Wet Market Trail

● National Schools Literature Festival
