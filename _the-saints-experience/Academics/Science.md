## Science



Our Science Department aims to equip students with the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes essential to scientific inquiry and practice. Through our curriculum, we seek to:

1.      Cultivate a deep and lasting interest in Science, inspiring future learning and careers.

2.      Develop scientifically literate citizens who think critically, innovate, and seize opportunities in the 21st century.

3.      Foster an appreciation for the practical applications of Science in everyday life and the world around them.

**Upper Secondary Science**

We offer Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Science (Phy/Chem), Science (Chem/Biology) and Science.

Our special programmes for lower secondary students provide a strong foundation for self-directed learning and scientific inquiry.

**1.**      **River Studies Programme**

·       **Secondary 1:** Students participate in our **River Studies Project**, applying scientific knowledge to investigate the Kallang River from its source to its endpoint. They focus on monitoring water quality and studying the river’s ecosystem.

·       **Secondary 2:** In **River Studies 2.0**, students extend their exploration to the **Kallang Park Connector**, conducting ecological surveys and fieldwork. They learn to analyze biodiversity and take ownership of their environment.

2.      **Making Science Alive!**  
 At St. Andrew’s Secondary, we believe in making science an engaging, hands-on experience. Our **Therapeutic Garden** offers students opportunities to explore scientific concepts beyond the classroom.

Through outdoor investigations, students examine how different surfaces absorb heat, comparing temperature variations in black and white surfaces, water tanks, and soil containers. Using data loggers, they collect and analyze real-time data, strengthening their scientific inquiry skills.

By connecting classroom learning to real-world applications, our students develop a deeper appreciation for science—just like real scientists!
