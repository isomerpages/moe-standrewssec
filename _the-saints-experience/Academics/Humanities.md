<h2>Humanities</h2>
<p><strong>Department vision:</strong>
</p>
<p>A Humanities education that empowers our students to think critically,
understand diverse perspectives, and engage meaningfully.</p>
<p><strong>The Saints’ Humanities Method</strong>
</p>
<p>The Saints’ Humanities department adopts an <strong>inquiry-based approach</strong> to
create authentic learning and student engagement.</p>
<p>Learning the Humanities subjects cultivates <strong>essential citizenship dispositions</strong> that
help students develop a sense of belonging, reality, and hope for Singapore's
future.</p>
<p>To get our students to be future ready, they are expected to be a 21<sup>st</sup> Century
competent learner. Hence our Saints are geared towards having to inquire
geographical, historical, and social issues, evaluate on their findings,
and make informed decisions.</p>

</p>
<p><u>A Sense of Belonging</u>

<p>Through Lower Secondary History, students trace Singapore's transformation
from a fishing village to a global city-state, fostering a deep connection
to our shared heritage. This understanding strengthens their emotional
rootedness to Singapore and their identity as Singaporeans.</p>

<p><u>A Sense of Reality and Action</u>
</p>
<p>Geography and Social Studies help students understand Singapore's limitations
as a small island nation with scarce resources. Through studying land constraints,
population issues, economic challenges and social cohesion, students learn
that Singapore's success requires constant effort. Real-world examples
of overcoming these challenges teach students about pragmatic problem-solving
and adaptation.</p>

<p><u>A Sense of Hope</u>
</p>
<p>Humanities education fosters hope by showing how Singapore transforms
challenges into opportunities through innovation and collective effort.
Students learn from historical triumphs over adversity, like surviving
the Japanese Occupation and Separation. Geography and Social Studies demonstrate
how Singapore's limitations become strengths through urban planning and
community initiatives.</p>
