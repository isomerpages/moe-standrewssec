## Humanities

Inquiry-based Approach to the Learning of Humanities. To get our students to be future ready, they are expected to be a 21st century competent learner. Hence, the Humanities subject syllabuses are geared towards the learner having to inquire geographical, historical and social issues, evaluate on their findings and make informed decisions.   

  

There are 2 prongs to this Inquiry-based approach. One requires our students to go out to the physical world to gain insights and data through GI and HI. The second approach is through studying, interpreting and evaluating information in teacher prepared case studies.
