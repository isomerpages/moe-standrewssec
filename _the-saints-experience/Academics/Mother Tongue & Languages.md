To support the school's strategic thrusts, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department aims to progress by keeping up with changes in society and in MOE policies while exploring creative teaching so as to raise students' interest in learning their MTL.

  

To enhance learning experiences, the MTL teachers leverage on Authentic Learning to create experiences that are similar to real world contexts – to encourage Saints to apply their learning in everyday life. We also support students in “learning by doing”, where students use the target language to complete learning tasks and, thereby, sharpen their language proficiency.
