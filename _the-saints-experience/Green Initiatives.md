<h2><strong>SAINTS’ ECO-STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMME</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Vision: To Nurture Future-Ready Green Stewards of the Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>The Saints’ Eco-Stewardship Programme aims to nurture generations of Singaporeans
with&nbsp;<strong>informed</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>responsible</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>sustainability-conscious mindsets and habits&nbsp;</strong>from
young.</p>
<p>Channel our youth’s interest in the environment towards having a sense
of hope and&nbsp;<strong>taking constructive action</strong>, undergirded
by&nbsp;<strong>sound values and knowledge</strong>, and a sensitivity
towards the Singapore context.</p>

<p>The Saints Eco-Stewardship Programme is an ongoing initiative at our school
that educates students and the community about environmental protection
and public health, aligned with the MOE eco-stewardship framework. This
year, we have integrated learning experiences across curriculum, community,
campus, and culture, with a focus on hands-on learning and community outreach.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting a ‘Green’ Culture and through Community Outreach</strong>
</p>
<p>The Green Envoys, a group of student environmental advocates, launched
a used-angpow-packet recycling drive post-Chinese New Year, sparking a
school-wide recycling competition that ignited a culture of recycling.
They also led sustainability-related VIA projects, including a textiles
recycling drive that collected 18 kg of clothes in collaboration with Green
Sproutz. An enhanced plastic-collection collaboration with Sembwaste introduced
a tonnage challenge, with Secondary 1 students promoting the 3Rs and engaging
about 150 elderly from Calvary Community Care, Viriya Family Services and
Kwong Wai Shiu Eldercare during our school community outreach day, Saints
Care Day. All secondary 2 students also played their part by advocating
for edible gardening, dengue prevention, and clean toilets.</p>

<p><strong>Promoting an Eco-Friendly Campus</strong>
</p>
<p>The Green Envoys also improved the aquaponics setup this year, creating
larger spaces for fish and enhancing nutrient cycling for healthy plant
growth. This setup has facilitated authentic science lessons, and we are
proud to be able to share our experiences with Minister Chan during his
visit this year.</p>

<p><strong>Go Green SG 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Aligned with Go Green SG’s Year of Public Health Campaign, our community
outreach efforts have gained the support of the Ministry of Sustainability
and Environment. During a community clean-up session with Senior Parliamentary
Secretary Mr. Baey Yam Keng, students emphasized the importance of a zero-litter
environment, clean toilets, water conservation, and the 3Rs. The event,
which collected over 12 kg of litter, sent a strong visual message about
environmental sustainability to the community, further reinforcing our
school’s commitment to conservation.</p>
