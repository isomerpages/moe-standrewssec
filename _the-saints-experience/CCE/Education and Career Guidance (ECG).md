<h2>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programmes in St Andrew’s School (Secondary)
aim to equip students with the knowledge, skills and values needed to make
informed decisions at key education stages to successfully transit from
school to further education or work.</p>
<p>Through the ECG lessons conducted in school, students will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>develop self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills for continuous
learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be empowered with accurate and comprehensive information that allow them
to explore possible career pathways&nbsp;and&nbsp;discover various education
options&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an appreciation to value all vocations and how they contribute
positively to society</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of Tier 1 support, the ECG curriculum is further enriched through
curated Student Development Experiences such as career talks and fairs,
visits to post-secondary education institutions, and industry exposure
opportunities. Students are also guided to use the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/MySFSec" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_new">MySkillsFuture Student Portal</a> to explore
their strengths, interests, and aspirations.</p>
<p>For Tiers 2 and 3 support, our students benefit from workshops, small-group
engagements, and one-to-one counselling sessions conducted by our ECG Counsellor.
The counsellor also works closely with teachers and parents through talks
and engagement sessions, ensuring that the Saints community remains well-informed
and supported in guiding our students towards purposeful education and
career choices.</p>
