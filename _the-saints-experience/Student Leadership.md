<p>SALT is premised on Servant Leadership by Robert Greenleaf (1970); The
key comes from the philosophy that “<em>The servant-leader is servant first… It begins with the natural </em><strong><em>feeling</em></strong><em> that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then </em><strong><em>conscious</em></strong><em> choice brings one to aspire to lead…</em>”.
Hence, SALT provides developmental and service opportunities to cultivate
the altruistic feeling to serve, the conscious choice to lead and finally
to serve in the communities where they belong. The servant leader should
demonstrate the 10 principles of servant leadership as show below:</p>
