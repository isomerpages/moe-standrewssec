<h1><strong>Serving And Leading Together</strong></h1>
<h3><em>“Home of Servant Leaders Who Bring Life to the Nations”</em></h3>
<p>Serving and Leading Together (SALT) is the Learning for Life (LLP) programme
in St Andrew’s Secondary School. The programme focuses on community and
youth leadership and aims to nurture students to be confident leaders who
pay it forward to the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SALT is premised on Servant Leadership by Robert Greenleaf (1970); The
key comes from the philosophy that “<em>The servant-leader is servant first… It begins with the natural </em><strong><em>feeling</em></strong><em> that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then </em><strong><em>conscious</em></strong><em> choice brings one to aspire to lead…</em>”.
Hence, SALT provides developmental and service opportunities to cultivate
the altruistic feeling to serve, the conscious choice to lead and finally
to serve in the communities where they belong. The servant leader should
demonstrate the 10 principles of servant leadership as show below:</p>

to serve, the conscious choice (think) to lead and finally to (serve) in
the communities where they belong</p>

<p>Students have multiple opportunities to develop their leadership competency
and demonstrate their leadership capacity in activities in the school community,
neighbourhood and wider community.</p>
