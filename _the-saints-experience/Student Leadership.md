<h1><strong>Serving And Leading Together</strong></h1>
<h3><em>“Home of Servant Leaders Who Bring Life to the Nations”</em></h3>
<p>Serving and Leading Together (SALT) is the Learning for Life (LLP) programme
in St Andrew’s School (Secondary). The programme focuses on community and
youth leadership and aims to nurture students to be confident leaders who
pay it forward to the community.</p>
<p>SALT is premised on Servant Leadership by Robert Greenleaf (1970). The
key idea comes from the philosophy that “<em>The servant-leader is servant first… It begins with the natural </em><strong><em>feeling</em></strong><em> that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then </em><strong><em>conscious</em></strong><em> choice brings one to aspire to lead…</em>”.
Hence, SALT provides developmental and service opportunities to cultivate
in our students the altruistic feeling to serve, the conscious choice to
lead and finally to serve in the communities where they belong. The servant
leader should demonstrate the 10 principles of servant leadership as show
below:</p>
