## Arts for the Saints


A special arts enrichment programme that is put together to excite and engage our students in developing their appreciation towards the arts, such as via the annual Arts and Design Festival, Performing Arts concerts and Hall Assembly programmes. 

  

The programmes during Hall Assembly expose Saints to the four different art forms – art, dance, drama, and music – and are carefully selected to tie in with the music curriculum. Our school stage has welcomed the likes of Gamelan Asmaradana, Singapore Dance Theatre, the T’ang Quartet, and even film-maker, Royston Tan.   


  

The highlight of every year is the Art and Design Festival. Over two days, an entire level of students is treated to a variety of workshops. Our Saints have participated in workshops on marbling, mime, capoeira, taiko drumming, just to name a few.
