<p>Aligned with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, all students participate in
River Studies, a two-year science signature program that fosters environmental
stewardship. Secondary 1 students explore ‘The Scientific Endeavor’ and
‘Separation Techniques’ through practical studies of the Kallang River,
using data loggers and DIY water purification devices to assess water quality.
They document their findings digitally and advocate for environmental conservation.
In Secondary 2, students enhance their learning of ‘Interactions within
Ecosystems’ through outdoor ecological surveys along the Kallang Park Connector,
contributing their findings to a biodiversity Padlet wall and writing ecological
reports.</p>

<p>We also invited environmental advocate, BioGirlMJ from Just Keep Thinking
and NUS lecturer Mr. Sivasothi to educate students and inspire students
about local biodiversity, fostering a love for nature.</p>

<p>Through the River Studies program, students research the role of gabions
along the Kallang River and observe various nature park networks that integrate
urban areas with greenery. This fosters awareness and commitment to promoting
a “City in Nature.” Enhancements to the aquaponics area and the construction
of a therapeutic garden also help restore nature within our school's urban
landscape, supporting Singapore's goal of being a City in Nature.</p>
