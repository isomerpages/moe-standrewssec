<p><em>For Secondary 3 students looking to enrol in G3 Art</em>
</p>
<p>The EAP in St Andrew's School (Secondary) is offered to Secondary 3 students
who are interested in furthering their love for art and design after experiencing
the foundational lower secondary art curriculum. EAP students are exposed
to different art practices to help them build a strong foundation for art
making and art appreciation. They will be equipped with the necessary aptitude
while nurturing thier creativity and technical skills for the future.</p>
<p>EAP builds upon students' foundational fine art practices of drawing and
painting and offers them exposure to digital and fine art practices. These
include digital photography, design and imaging. Mastery and appreciation
in fine art areas is deepened by exposure in mark making and art response
and appreciation through the teaching and learning of artworks. The Artist-in-Residence
programme encourages interaction with visual art and design practitioners,
offering students insights and exposure to real-world application to their
art learning experiences. In addition, field trips to art spaces locally
and overseas extend students' learning beyond the school.</p>
