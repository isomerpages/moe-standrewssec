<p>At St Andrew’s School (Secondary), we believe in nurturing Saints who
are confident, responsible, and purpose-driven. Our inaugural <strong>Secondary 3 Work Experience Programme (WEP)</strong> provides
students with the opportunity to step beyond the classroom and explore
the working world firsthand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During this compulsory programme, students are placed in a variety of
organisations across industries, ranging from law firms and engineering
collaborations to sports associations. Through these attachments, they
gain insights into different career paths, develop workplace skills, and
understand the real-world relevance of their learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The WEP helps students build essential life skills such as communication,
teamwork, adaptability, and self-reflection. More importantly, it allows
them to discover their strengths, interests, and passions — key steps in
the journey of becoming servant leaders who bring life to the nations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By combining experiential learning with the school’s values of WISE &amp;
TRUE, the WEP ensures that every Saint leaves with not only new knowledge
but also increased confidence and a deeper sense of purpose.</p>
<p></p>
