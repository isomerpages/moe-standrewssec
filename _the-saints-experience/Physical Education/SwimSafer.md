## Swim Safer 2.0

### Swimming Module for 1s & 2s (Swim Safer 2.0)

*   Sec 2s are grouped according to their swimming ability based on the assessment they had in sec 1.
*   They will have to progress to the next level of swim training based on their most recent swimming assessment and level.
*   The swimming assessment will commence in Term 2 and upon clearing the assessment, they will be issue certificates.
*   Swimming is a 2 year PE program which involves sec 1s and 2s.
*   The Sec 1s will embark on their programme in term 3.
*   The swimming abilities of the sec 1s have been assessed once during their sec 1 orientation in Term 1 week 1.
*   They will be reassessed prior to the commencement of their swimming program.

SwimSafer 2.0, the enhanced programme, will provide participants with a more rigourous water survival and swimming competency programme. The revamped programme comes with a revised syllabus and assessment approach, together with enhanced instructor quality through training and re-certification to provide quality learning for participants. It also incorporates an online quiz on water safety knowledge for participants to consolidate their learning.

“Swimming and engaging in water activities are popular pastimes for Singaporeans. Last year, over 7.2 million people used our pools. While we encourage more people to be active through sport and physical activity, we must always play safe and stay safe,” said Mr Lai Chin Kwang, Chief, ActiveSG.

“Equipping a person with water safety knowledge and skills can make a difference between life and death. SwimSafer has helped to equip many Singaporean adults and children with essential water survival skills since its inauguration. We will continue to enhance the programme to maintain its quality and relevance,” Mr Lai added.

Key changes

1.  Syllabus – There will be greater focus on water survival skills and swimming competencies, through a stronger emphasis on participants’ practice time and skills progression. An online quiz has also been added to the enhanced version. This will help participants consolidate their knowledge of water safety, including a better understanding of the differences between swimming in a pool and in other water conditions. Upon completion of the online quiz and practical assessment, participants will receive an electronic certificate.
2.  Assessment Protocol – Instead of assessing separate skill-sets, participants are now required to demonstrate relevant skills in a sequence that mirrors water survival situations more realistically.  This will allow participants to showcase their competencies more effectively and efficiently, and ensure participants have fully mastered the skills imparted.
3.  Professional Development and Certification of Instructors – Instructors are now required to renew their certification every three years with mandatory hours of continuous coach education to ensure that they are up-to-date with content knowledge and pedagogical practices.

In 2017, more than 68,000 participants took part in the SwimSafer programme. SwimSafer was launched in 2010 as an integration of the Learn to Swim Programme and the National Survival Swimming Award programme, with the aim of providing Singaporeans from diverse age groups with a national water safety programme. All MOE primary schools currently offer SwimSafer to their students, as part of PE lessons, and will adopt the enhanced programme from 2018. 

  

SwimSafer 2.0 (Revised)
-----------------------

###### STAGE 1 : iNTRODUCTION TO WATER SKILLS



The objective is develop confidence and independence in the water, learn general and deep-end water safety. Techniques taught include the forward and backward movement, safe entry and exit and personal water safety.

  

##### Assessment

Swim : Incorporated in Sequence A

Sequence A : Slide-in Entry (w/o goggles), swim on back 5m, submerge in water identify object, front float 5 secs, back float 5 seconds, swim on front 10m, signal distress and call for help, grasp float and float for 10 secs, move towards pool edge and exit safely.

Sequence B : Dressed in swimwear t-shirt and shorts (w/o goggles), correctly fit a PFD, jump into water, float for 30 seconds, and then climb out of water

  

##### STAGE 2 : fundamental WATER SKILLS

  

General skill development including unassisted step entry into water, sculling, feet first surface dives, personal water safety skills as well as water safety in quatic environments. One of the goals is to achieve 25 metres of continuous swimming.



##### Assessment

Swim : Swim on front 25m, swim on back 15m

Sequence A : Step-in Entry (w/o goggles), front float 10 secs, swim on front 5m, back float 10 secs, swim on back 5m, scull float or thread water for 30 seconds, recover submerged object, resurface and exit pool safely.

Sequence B : Dressed in swimwear t-shirt and shorts (w/o goggles), swim 15m using any survival stroke, Correctly fit a PFD, jump into water, swim 25m, and then climb out of water

  

##### STAGE 3 : personal & stroke development SKILLS

  

Entry skills such as the stride jump will be taught. Skills include sculling, underwater skills and putting on a personal floatation device (PFD) whilst in water and swimming with it. One of the goals is to achieve 50 metres of continuous swimming.



##### Assessment

Swim : 25m backstroke, 25m front crawl

Sequence A : Straddle Entry (w/o goggles), swim 25m survival backstroke, 25m breaststroke, scull on back 5m, scull float or tread for another 50 secs, swim underwater through hoops 2m apart, resurface and exit pool.

Sequence B : Dressed in swimwear t-shirt and shorts (w/o goggles), swim 25m using survival stroke (face clear) to PFD, correctly fit a PFD in water, swim 50m with PFD, then exit pool.

  

##### Bronze : personal survival & stroke improvement skills

  

development of student's stroke techniques is a focus here, along with coordinated breathing in deep water. This stage sees the introduction of throw rescues and more personal survival skills. One of the goals is to achieve 100 metres of a variety of strokes.


##### Assessment
