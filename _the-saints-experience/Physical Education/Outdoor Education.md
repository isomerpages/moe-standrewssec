Secondary 1 Outdoor
-------------------

Our Sec 1s will be embarking on an Outdoor Education(OE)/River Studies collaboration programme starting next week. They will be involved in a variety of outdoor activities during their respective PE lessons. The students will be taught concepts such as map reading, bearing, knots tying, water collection from the river, water filtration as well as assessing risks in an outdoor environment.

  

Our Sec 2s will be embarking on the next level of outdoor orienteering and that first aid and CPR will also be introduced to the students. Students will also be given the opportunities to be exposed to the outdoor cooking.

  

Please take note that they will be using their mobile devices during certain lessons as part of orienteering process within this school compound. Do ask any of the PE teachers first if you feel a need to clarify.

  

We hope to achieve these objectives through this initiative;

·  a **confident student** who is adaptable to ever-changing environment during OE and resilient to challenges, thinks independently and critically, and communicates effectively with his team members from his class.

·  a **self-directed learner** who questions the process, reflects his actions during OE, perseveres and takes responsibility for his own learning throughout the River Studies programme.

·  an **active contributor** who is able to work effectively in teams during the River Studies programme, is innovative during problem-solving, exercises initiative during the tasks, takes calculated risks and strives for excellence.

·  a **concerned citizen** who has a strong sense of civic responsibility throughout this programme and takes an active part in bettering the environment and lives of others around him.
