#### Scope & Sequence of the Secondary Syllabus


The **secondary level physical education syllabus** builds on the foundation for quality movement laid at the primary level to enhance students’ mature performance across different specialised situations and physical activities, so that students become **competent and enthusiastic athletes**.

Schools will have the flexibility to plan and offer other interesting activities to their students, where possible, for them to learn, master and apply the skills and understanding in a new context.

The ELOs for outdoor education and physical health and fitness have been identified for specific secondary grades.

For the other learning areas, schools should provide opportunities for students to participate competently, by being able to carry out the physical activities they have learnt in schools **independently and safely on their own, beyond school**.

At least **six** different physical activities should be offered, (of which at least one from each game category, i.e., territorial-invasion, net-barrier and striking-fielding) and they could be selected from:

#### 21st Century Competencies in Physical Education


Physical education has a natural affordance for students to clarify and act on their personal values and demonstrate positive emotions and social behaviours. It is an authentic setting which allows for social interactions to emerge frequently. Furthermore, the interactive and problem-solving nature of many physical activities means that students have numerous instances to communicate positively with others, source for information, as well as to think critically and creatively – all necessary for 21st century living. Through carefully designed learning tasks and activities, changes to student’s attainment of values, social development, and higher order thinking skills can be achieved.

In this syllabus, ELOs for the social and affective development of students are identified for different learning areas across specific levels. However, teachers and schools should appropriately include other affective outcomes which are deemed consistent with their school’s mission, values and Character and Citizenship Education efforts. The teaching of social emotional skills and values must be well conceived and taught through physical education to bring about the total development of our students.
