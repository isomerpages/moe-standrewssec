<h2>Basketball</h2>
<p>The Basketball Team is a testament to perseverance, teamwork, and unwavering
dedication. The team started with humble beginnings, driven by a shared
passion for the sport and an unbreakable bond. Without the luxuries of
an established programme, our Basketball Saints forged their own path through
sheer hard work and determination, gradually transforming themselves into
a cohesive unit on the court. Each training session, each game, and each
setback has only strengthened our Basketball Saints’ resolve, shaping them
into a team that thrives under pressure and embraces every challenge as
an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Known for their grit and resilience, the team has earned a reputation
for never backing down, no matter the odds. Whether facing stronger or
more experienced opponents, they approach every battle with relentless
energy and a never-say-die attitude. Their journey is not just about winning
games but about embodying the values of perseverance, sportsmanship, and
self-belief. The St Andrew’s Basketball Team is more than a team—it is
a brotherhood built on heart, hustle, and unshakable commitment<strong>. </strong>Up
and On!</p>
