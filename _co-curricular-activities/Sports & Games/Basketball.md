<h2>Basketball</h2>
<p>The St Andrew’s Secondary School Basketball Team is a testament to perseverance,
teamwork, and unwavering dedication. The team started with humble beginnings,
driven by a shared passion for the sport and an unbreakable bond. Without
the luxuries of an established programme, our Basketball Saints forged
their own path through sheer hard work and determination, gradually transforming
themselves into a cohesive unit on the court. Each training session, each
game, and each setback has only strengthened our Basketball Saints’ resolve,
shaping them into a team that thrives under pressure and embraces every
challenge as an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Known for their grit and resilience, the team has earned a reputation
for never backing down, no matter the odds. Whether facing stronger or
more experienced opponents, they approach every battle with relentless
energy and a never-say-die attitude. Their journey is not just about winning
games but about embodying the values of perseverance, sportsmanship, and
self-belief. The St Andrew’s Basketball Team is more than a team—it is
a brotherhood built on heart, hustle, and unshakable commitment<strong>. </strong>Up
and On!</p>
