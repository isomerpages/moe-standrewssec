<h2>Drama</h2>
<p>At the heart of our Drama Club lies the guiding principles of <strong>Passion</strong>, <strong>Perseverance</strong>,
and <strong>Perfection</strong>. These values shape the way we approach
every production, every rehearsal, and every opportunity for growth. We
believe that through passionate commitment, the willingness to push through
challenges, and the pursuit of excellence, we can create extraordinary
performances that leave a lasting impact on our audience.</p>
<p>We are proud to host <strong>Biennial School Performances</strong>, where
we showcase the culmination of our hard work and creativity. In 2024, our
Drama Club had the privilege of participating in the joint arts presentation
titled <strong>Vivace</strong>, in collaboration with our talented school
band and choir. This collaborative spirit is a core part of our ethos,
as we believe in the power of teamwork to create truly outstanding art.</p>
<p>Our Drama Club is also known for its exceptional achievements in the <strong>Singapore Youth Festival</strong>  <strong>(SYF)</strong>,
where we have consistently been recognized for our excellence. In <strong>2023</strong>,
we were honoured with the <strong>Distinction</strong> award, a testament
to the dedication and skill of every member involved.</p>
<p>Additionally, we actively participate in <strong>Inter-School Drama Exchange Programmes</strong>,
where we engage with other schools to learn, share, and grow. These experiences
allow us to hone our craft, exchange ideas, and form lasting connections
with like-minded performers.</p>
<p>Through these experiences and accomplishments, we strive to continually
refine our craft and reach new heights. Join us as we bring our passion
for drama to life on stage and continue our journey of perseverance and
perfection in every performance we create!</p>
