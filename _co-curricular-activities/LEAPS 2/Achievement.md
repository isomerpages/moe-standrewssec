## Achievement 

This domain recognises the different levels of representation and accomplishment in the student's co-curricular involvement in school or other external organisations. Representation refers to being selected and endorsed by an organisation (e.g. the school or community club) to contribute, compete or perform at an event. Self-representation or personal participation (e.g. performing at a concert with no endorsement from any organisation) is not recognised. 

**Purpose**

This domain serves to recognise the diverse talents and interests of every student. To provide a broad range of opportunities and platforms, and multiple pathways for success, the criteria recognises achievements beyond representation and winning accolades and awards at competitions. It recognises the representation and attainment of awards at festivals, performances, concerts, exhibitions, conferences and symposiums. These events can be organised by the school and/or external organisations. Representation at these events need not be tied to a student's chosen CCA in school. 

Importantly, the school and students have to ensure the quality and appropriateness of these events in order for the students to derive meaningful learning experiences from it.  

Importance of Representation of School or Organisation in Competitions, Festivals or Equivalent  

The criteria is designed to reflect the progression of representation in intra-school to inter-school, to international events. Higher levels of attainment recognise sustained representation over the years, serving as an affirmation of students’ abilities and hard work put in through regular, dedicated training and practices. The level of attainment for students who achieve excellence at such competitions, festivals or their equivalent, i.e. win accolades or awards, is at least one level higher as compared to that of representation. For example, a student who represented the school in a competition for a year would be awarded Level 2 attainment. If he/she were to obtain a top four placing in the same competition, he/she would be awarded Level 3 attainment. 

**Level 1** 

recognises student representation at intra-school events for a year or more. The student is expected to participate in some form of intra-school events or their equivalent for a baseline co-curricular experience. He/she can represent his/her class, house or CCA at the intra-school event. Intra-school events may include inter-class games, quizzes, performances at school concerts, or school assembly sessions in which the students are the participants. In such events, the audience does not include members of the public. 

**Level 2** 

recognises the student who represents his/her school or an external organisation at local / international events for a year. 

For competitions and festivals, this refers to inter-school, inter-club, national age-group and national events organised by schools, Singapore Schools Sports Council (e.g. National School Games), Uniformed Groups Headquarters (UG HQ), community and sports clubs, and national bodies, among others.

For performances and concerts, this refers to public events for which members of the public should form part of the target audience. These events can be organised by schools, MOE (e.g. Singapore Youth Festival \[SYF\] Arts Presentation or SYF Celebrations), community centres, performing arts groups and other organisations.

Recognition can be extended to the supporting students who provide the main logistic support in a public concert or equivalent, as they contribute significantly to the overall quality of the event. An example is the recognition of students from AVA / IT Club who provide the AVA / IT support for the organisation of the public concert by the Dance CCA.

In the case of representation at local exhibitions, conferences, symposiums or their equivalent for one year, students’ representation will be considered if students have active roles as project presenters, exhibitors and conference delegates. This differs from participating in the exhibitions, conferences and symposiums as members of the audience or visitors, where the students take on a more passive role seeking to acquire more knowledge on a specific subject. Such participation will not be considered as representation. On the other hand, if students attend such events in order to present an original research paper/project which was accepted by the organising body, they should be accorded with recognition higher than Level 2.

Representation of school or external organisation at an international event for one year only is also pegged at Level 2 as the standards of international competitions can vary widely.

**Level 3** 

recognises the student who represents his/her school or an external organisation at local / international events for two years. 

Representation needs to occur across two different years. This is because sustained representation across the years signifies a certain progression as it allows the student to learn and improve. For example, the student can attain Level 3 by representing his/her community dance troupe in public concerts in two different years.

The student can also be recognised for his/her representation in two different genres of activities as long as the two events fall in different years. The two years of representation does not need to be with the same organisation as well. For example, the student can represent his/her sports club to compete in an inter-club tennis competition in one year and represent the school to present his/her artworks in a photography exhibition in another year.

This level also recognises the student who represents his/her school or an external organisation at local / international events and won accolades / awards for one year.

**Level 4** 

recognises the student who represents his/her school or an external organisation at local / international events for three years or more, as well as the student who represents the UG HQ in international events (excluding competitions). A student who won accolades / awards for two years or more will also be awarded this level. 

**Level 5** 

recognises the high ability student who represents MOE, the Singapore Schools Sports Teams, National Projects of Excellence (e.g. Singapore National Youth Orchestra and Singapore Youth Chinese Orchestra) or the nation in local / international events. It also recognises the student who represents the UG HQ in international competitions. This level affirms those who have displayed exceptional talent in their specialised area and a high level of commitment and rigour over time. 

Levels 1 to 5 

also recognise the progressive attainment of UG badges. Level 5 in particular recognises students with outstanding contribution in the UG, which are comparable to the high ability students who have represented MOE and the nation (or equivalent).
