## Leadership 

This domain recognises the student’s leadership development in terms of participation in student leadership modules, formal leadership appointments, the National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) and leadership positions in student-initiated/student-led projects. 

**Purpose**  

This domain serves to recognise the student's development of personal and inter-personal effectiveness, which enables the student to effectively assume responsibilities that serve his/her peers and the community. Hence, the recognition of leadership development is not limited to leadership positions, but also the extent to which the student takes charge of his/her own learning and development (e.g. through NYAA), and contributes to the community. 

Student leadership development can be broadly divided into three tiers: Self-Leadership, Group Leadership, and School-level Leadership. 

**Self Leadership**

Every student can be developed in his/her leadership competencies. As such, every student should be given the opportunity to attend leadership training that develops the student's character, values and personal skills, and which guides the student to formulate personal goals to achieve, as well as be a good team player. Through this training, students will develop their individual leadership capabilities, allowing them to take responsibility for their own learning and development.

The National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) is a youth development programme that encourages personal qualities of self-reliance, perseverance and responsibility. Students engage in various types of projects ranging from skills development to community service in order to improve themselves and contribute to the larger community. Their efforts towards building their leadership capacities are recognised under this tier.

 **Group Leadership**

It encompasses student leaders of groups such as classes, CCA, student-initiated or student-led project teams. The domain recognises and rewards these leaders by pegging the recognition at Level 2 and above.

 **School Level Leadership**

Student leadership at the school-level includes councillors, house captains, and CCA Executive Committee leaders who often take on multiple responsibilities. They are expected to be role models for the school and the larger community. This group of leaders often devote much time and effort to their leadership role, and are thus recognised with a Level 3 attainment level and above.

**Levels of Attainment**

The level of attainment is first determined by the student's leadership position. Subsequently, the level may be adjusted if the student is deemed to have demonstrated a greater extent of leadership impact than expected of his/her leadership position.

At Level 1, the student should complete at least two modules of leadership training which will prepare him/her for leadership roles in the future. This is set as a baseline experience that all schools will provide to enable each student to be responsible in his/her role as a supporting member of a team who participates in various school and community events.  

Level 2 recognises the student who takes initiative, actively contributes and makes an impact on the class or small groups within the CCA. He/she may be a beginning leader who is starting to gain some experience and confidence in exercising self-leadership and/or leading small groups. It also recognises the student who embarks on the NYAA and obtains a Bronze Award, as he/she demonstrates the initiative to undergo the rigorous self-development programme and serve the community in the process. 

Level 3 recognises the student who demonstrates confidence and strong leadership skills in assuming responsibilities which impact peers from other classes, CCA and even the whole cohort. This student is also able to communicate effectively, and has good organisational and team management skills to influence peers towards achieving common goals. It also recognises the student who has sustained involvement in NYAA activities and obtains a Silver Award or beyond, as he/she demonstrates a greater level of responsibility for both his/her personal development and service to the community. 

Levels 4 and 5 recognise the student who holds top leadership positions in school or at the national level. He/she displays exceptional ability in leading and mentoring big groups across levels or the whole school. He/she is often seen as a role model who is able to inspire the masses towards accomplishing tasks that have higher purposes.
