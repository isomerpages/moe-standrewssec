## Change of CCA

Students who are keen to experience a different CCA offered in school may opt for a change at the **beginning of each academic year**. In such cases, the number of years of participation in the previous CCA can be credited to the student's new CCA. 

**In St Andrew's Secondary School, the CCA transfer window will be the whole of term 1.**

**If any students want to change their CCAs in other terms, it will be done on case by case basis.**

**Change of CCA is applicable for lower secondary only.**

Continuous involvement in and commitment to the same CCA will be rewarded, and this is reflected through a higher level of attainment assigned to students who stay with the same CCA over the years. Continuous and regular participation in a CCA throughout the secondary school years is fundamental to contributing to the quality of school life and overall student development with the students deepening their knowledge and skills in a particular area. 

There could be several exceptional and valid reasons that may affect the continual participation of a student in his/her CCA, through no fault of the student. These include:

**(i)**       **medical concerns;**

If a student is required to change his/her CCA due to medical reasons, the student will be considered as having been in the same CCA. 

For example, if a student in a Physical Sports CCA sustains an injury and is hence unable to continue in the CCA, the student will be considered as having been in the same CCA, even though he/she switches to a new CCA that replaces the original Physical Sports CCA. 

**(ii)**      **the closure of a CCA;**

If a student is required to change his/her CCA due to the closure of their CCA (for reasons that are not within their control, such as school-based decisions), the student will be considered as having been in the same CCA. 

**(iii)**    **no corresponding CCA for transfer students in their new school.**

In addition, if a student transfers to another secondary school which does not offer the CCA that he/she belonged to in his/her previous school, the student will be considered as having been in the same CCA. The same would apply if the student does not meet the criteria in the new school to join the CCA that he/she belonged to in his/her previous school. 

Similarly, if the student comes from an overseas school that does not have co-curricular activities, the student will be considered as having been in the same CCA.   

However, if a student transfers to another secondary school which offers the CCA that he/she belonged to in his/her previous school but the student chooses to participate in a different CCA in the new school, the student will not be considered as having been in the same CCA.  

**In such cases, the student would be considered as having been in the same CCA.**
