## LEAPS 2.0

**Introduction**

LEAPS 2.0 recognises students' experiential learning and attainment in the four domains of the co-curriculum as they progress through their secondary school years.

At the end of the graduating year, students' co-curricular attainment will be recognised. This recognition will be translated to bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Technical Education (JC/Poly/ITE).

Overview of the LEAPS domain in the Co- Curriculum

The domains are: 

**a.** **Participation**

This domain recognises the student's participation in school-based Co-curricular Activities (CCA) for the development of specific knowledge and skills, be it in Clubs and Societies (CS), Physical Sports (PS), Uniformed Groups (UG) or Visual and Performing Arts (VPA). Sustained engagement over four to five years in a chosen CCA allows for the progressive development of skills and knowledge, character development, forging of friendships and building of team spirit. 

**b. Achievement**  

This domain recognises the different levels of representation and accomplishment in the student's involvement in school or other external organisations. Representing the school or external organisations in competitions, festivals or their equivalent provides the platform for students to actualise and showcase their talent as well as benchmark their level of mastery. The opportunity to go through the learning process, be disciplined and rigorous in preparation, and strive for excellence presents valuable learning experiences for the student. Accomplishments (e.g. winning medals, accolades and awards) at these platforms are also recognised. 

**c. Leadership**  

This domain recognises the development of the student's leadership dispositions - as an individual who can lead himself/herself, work with others in a team and grow as a leader to become a confident person. It recognises a plethora of school leadership learning opportunities, ranging from participation in student leadership programmes, to leading projects, to formal leadership appointments. 

 **d. Service**

This domain recognises the student's development as an individual who is socially responsible and understands his/her role in contributing to the well-being of others. Participation in Values in Action (VIA) projects such as service-learning encourages the student to take ownership and identify the community issues they are concerned about, and initiate action among peers to make a difference and improve the lives of others.

**e. Enrichment**  

The Enrichment domain forms an integral part of the co-curriculum. To provide more flexibility to schools to design enrichment programmes beneficial for their students' profiles, the Enrichment domain will not be included as one of the criteria for the awarding of bonus point(s). Nonetheless, the Enrichment domain is relevant and important. To reflect the integral place of enrichment in students’ holistic learning, the key school-based Enrichment modules completed by each student are captured in the Enrichment Module of the School Cockpit and will also be reflected in the student’s Holistic Development Profile (HDP), Co-Curriculum Certificate (CC) and School Graduation Certificate (SGC).
