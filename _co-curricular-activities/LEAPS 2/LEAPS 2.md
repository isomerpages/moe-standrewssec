## LEAPS 2.0

**Introduction**

LEAPS 2.0 recognises students' experiential learning and attainment in the four domains of the co-curriculum as they progress through their secondary school years.

At the end of the graduating year, students' co-curricular attainment will be recognised. This recognition will be translated to bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Technical Education (JC/Poly/ITE).

Overview of the LEAPS domain in the Co- Curriculum

The domains are: 

**a.** **Participation**

This domain recognises the student's participation in school-based Co-curricular Activities (CCA) for the development of specific knowledge and skills, be it in Clubs and Societies (CS), Physical Sports (PS), Uniformed Groups (UG) or Visual and Performing Arts (VPA). Sustained engagement over four to five years in a chosen CCA allows for the progressive development of skills and knowledge, character development, forging of friendships and building of team spirit. 

**b. Achievement**  

This domain recognises the different levels of representation and accomplishment in the student's involvement in school or other external organisations. Representing the school or external organisations in competitions, festivals or their equivalent provides the platform for students to actualise and showcase their talent as well as benchmark their level of mastery. The opportunity to go through the learning process, be disciplined and rigorous in preparation, and strive for excellence presents valuable learning experiences for the student. Accomplishments (e.g. winning medals, accolades and awards) at these platforms are also recognised. 

**c. Leadership**  

This domain recognises the development of the student's leadership dispositions - as an individual who can lead himself/herself, work with others in a team and grow as a leader to become a confident person. It recognises a plethora of school leadership learning opportunities, ranging from participation in student leadership programmes, to leading projects, to formal leadership appointments. 

 **d. Service**

This domain recognises the student's development as an individual who is socially responsible and understands his/her role in contributing to the well-being of others. Participation in Values in Action (VIA) projects such as service-learning encourages the student to take ownership and identify the community issues they are concerned about, and initiate action among peers to make a difference and improve the lives of others.

**e. Enrichment**  

The Enrichment domain forms an integral part of the co-curriculum. To provide more flexibility to schools to design enrichment programmes beneficial for their students' profiles, the Enrichment domain will not be included as one of the criteria for the awarding of bonus point(s). Nonetheless, the Enrichment domain is relevant and important. To reflect the integral place of enrichment in students’ holistic learning, the key school-based Enrichment modules completed by each student are captured in the Enrichment Module of the School Cockpit and will also be reflected in the student’s Holistic Development Profile (HDP), Co-Curriculum Certificate (CC) and School Graduation Certificate (SGC).  

Philosophical Intent
--------------------

LEAPS 2.0 is designed to ensure that all students, regardless of their socio-economic background, have the opportunities to learn and be developed through a student-centric and holistic co-curricular experience. It is framed by the following philosophical intent: 

**a. Motivating Holistic and Balanced Education**



  

Beyond quantifying and recognising student involvement, LEAPS 2.0 seeks to motivate holistic and balanced participation in the co-curriculum. With equal weighting given to all the four domains and the requirement of a minimum level of attainment in each domain, students will be encouraged to develop in every domain, thereby becoming well-rounded individuals.

  



**b. Shaping Learning and Attainment of Skills and Competencies**



  

LEAPS 2.0 seeks to shape co-curricular experiences that encourage students to develop skills and competencies that would enable them to lead a meaningful and purposeful life, and be prepared for an uncertain and changing world. The levels of attainment in each domain are designed such that Level 1 in each domain is the baseline standard expected of every student, Level 3 in each domain is the standard that most students should be able to achieve with hard work and determination, and Level 5 in each domain is the highest standard achievable for the student at that point in time. 

  


**c. Facilitating Self-Directed Learners**



  

The use of levels of attainment in each domain helps students focus on the efforts required for progression in the pursuit of excellence. The different levels of attainment serve to motivate students to initiate personal challenges and set targets, take responsibility of their own learning and development, and pursue mastery of the knowledge, skills or competencies. Schools should therefore encourage students to take ownership and work towards the different levels of attainment within each domain in the spirit of learning and continuous improvement.

  



**d. Recognising Students' Diverse Interests and the Role of the Community in the Holistic Development of each Student**



  

Aligned with student-centric education, LEAPS 2.0 recognises each student's diverse interests and involvement. Whilst schools are able to cater to the general needs of students, individuals must be supported to pursue their interests and passion. Therefore, students may develop in a particular domain through activities organised by external organisations, and the learning/attainment can subsequently be recognised in the Achievement and Service domains under LEAPS 2.0, subject to schools' endorsement. Endorsing the student's external involvements beyond the school acknowledges the importance of partnerships with the community in developing the whole child. A school-home-community approach to develop a student is therefore encouraged. Such learning from external organisations also does not need to be tied to any particular CCA or school. 

  

This recognition of students' external involvements does not apply to the Participation and Leadership domains. This ensures that there remain core platforms for schools to leverage for character and competencies building and citizenship education.
