## Recognition of Students’ Co Curricular Attainment

At the end of the graduating year, the student’s co-curricular attainment will be recognised according to the table below. The co-curricular attainment will be translated to bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges / Polytechnics / Institutes of Technical Education (JC/Poly/ITE)

| **Co-curricular Attainment** | **Descriptor** | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Excellent     | The student has fulfilled the requirements for holistic development and achieved quality learning in the co-curriculum. | 
| Good    | The student has fulfilled the requirements for holistic development in the co-curriculum.  | 
| Fair   | The student is working towards holistic development in the co-curriculum.  | 

For an Excellent co-curricular attainment, which is translated to two bonus points, the student should have **attained a minimum Level 3 in all four domains with at least Level 4 in one domain.** 

For a Good co-curricular attainment, which is translated to one bonus point, the student should have **attained a minimum Level 1 in all four domains** with any one of the following:

·  At least Level 2 in three domains;

·  At least Level 2 in one domain and at least Level 3 in another domain; or

·  At least Level 4 in one domain.

A Fair co-curricular attainment will not translate into any bonus points as the student has not met the minimum criteria for a Good co-curricular attainment.
