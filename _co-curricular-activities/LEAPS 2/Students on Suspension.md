## Students on Suspension 

If a student is not allowed to attend his/her CCA training sessions because he/she is suspended from school, the 75% attendance for that year will be derived from the total number of sessions that the student is able to attend, given his/her suspension (instead of the usual total number of sessions in the year). This is because the student has already been penalised by the suspension and hence should not be doubly penalised in terms of attendance. The school may also have given other forms of punishment (e.g. demerit points and detention) for the student’s misbehaviour. 

  

Similarly, if the student is suspended from CCA, the 75% attendance should also be calculated based on the number of sessions the student is able to attend. The student will only be penalised in his/her CCA participation if he/she wilfully skips CCA.
