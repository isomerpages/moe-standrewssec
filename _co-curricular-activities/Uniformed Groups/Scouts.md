<h2>Scouts</h2>
<p><strong>St. Andrew's Star Scout Group </strong>has scouts age ranged 12-17.</p>
<p>These are some of the things that we scouts do.</p>
<p><strong>1. Outdoor/Indoor cooking</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>2. Pioneering</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Exploration</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>4. Job Week/Diamond Jubilee Fund Raising</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Job week &amp; Diamond Jubilee Fund Raising </strong>is an event
happening every year. The scouts will go to each house and ask for a job
to earn money. The purpose of this event is to understand the importance
of hardship, to see how it is like to take up an odd job and it gives you
a real life experience of working. It is a unique yet meaningful event
that scouts experience every year.</p>
<p>We aim to&nbsp;inculcate discipline, leadership qualities and teamwork
attributes through informal education processes at various formative stages.&nbsp;Scouting
is a non-formal self-education system, which composes of different elements
which work together to provide a rich, active and fun learning environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In scouts, we learn by doing.&nbsp;Learning by doing means developing
as a result of first-hand experience. It reflects the active way in which
one gains knowledge, skills and attitudes through a practical approach.
Learning by doing as a patrol also allows everyone in the patrol to actively
engage with the process, take ownership and learn how to work with different
kind of people with different attitudes.</p>
<p>One aspect that makes scouts special is the patrol system.&nbsp;The patrol
system is the basic organisational structure in Scouting. Each small group,
normally comprising
<br>5-6 Scouts, operates as a team with two members acting as a Patrol leader
and an Assistant Patrol leader. Within each team and in ways appropriate
to their capacities, the Scouts organise their life as a group, sharing
responsibilities, learning from each other's strength and weaknesses and
working as a team. This moulds a teenager to handle different personalities
when he or she goes to the work force.</p>

<h3>Events</h3>
<p><strong>Recruit Training Camp (RTC)</strong>
</p>
<p>The recruit training camp is a highly anticipated event that serves as
a vital platform for the development of leadership, discipline, and camaraderie
amongst our Scouts. The primary objective of the camp is to empower our
Patrol Leader Council the opportunity to plan a camp equipping the new
recruits with basic scouting skills, and for the seniors to train and guide
the new recruits.</p>
