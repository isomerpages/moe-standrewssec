## Early Admissions Exercise - Polytechnics

####   
EAE IS AN ADMISSIONS EXERCISE THAT ALLOWS STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR ADMISSION TO POLYTECHNIC BASED ON THEIR INTERESTS AND APTITUDES, AND SECURE A PLACE IN A POLYTECHNIC DIPLOMA COURSE PRIOR TO THEIR GCE O-LEVEL EXAMINATIONS.

It allows the polytechnics greater flexibility to select students on a broader measure of aptitude beyond just academic grades, thus allowing a wider range of talents to be recognised.

All five polytechnics participate in EAE:

*   Nanyang Polytechnic
*   Ngee Ann Polytechnic
*   Republic Polytechnic
*   Singapore Polytechnic
*   Temasek Polytechnic

#### WHEN DOES EAE BEGIN?

EAE will begin on 22 June 2016, for admission into the polytechnics in 2017.

#### WHAT IS THE SELECTION CRITERIA FOR EAE?

Each polytechnic course has its own selection criteria. In considering your application, the polytechnics will take into account your aptitudes for and interests in the specific [courses](http://www.polytechnic.edu.sg/introduction/available-courses) that you are applying for. Students with other outstanding talents and achievements, such as in sports, arts, leadership, entrepreneurship and community service, can also be considered under EAE.

If you have received a conditional offer through EAE, you must still meet the criteria for admissions to a polytechnic and the specific polytechnic course you have applied for in order to confirm a place in the course. This is to better assure that students admitted through EAE will be able to cope with the rigour of a polytechnic education.

Once you secure a place in the polytechnic through EAE, you will not be eligible to take part in the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) or other polytechnic admissions exercises.

#### THE JUNIOR COLLEGE (JC) ROUTE

If you are interested in the JC pathway and wish to gain direct admission to a JC, you can participate in the [Direct School Admissions – Junior College (DSA-JC) Exercise](https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/direct-admissions/dsa-jc), which is conducted during the same period as EAE.

Please visit the [DSA-JC Exercise website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/direct-admissions/dsa-jc) for more information on the DSA-JC Exercise.

Note: While you can participate in both DSA-JC Exercise and EAE, you may not accept both JC and polytechnic places. Students who accept both EAE and DSA-JC offers will be disqualified from both exercises, unless they cancel one of the offers before the end of the Acceptance Stage.
