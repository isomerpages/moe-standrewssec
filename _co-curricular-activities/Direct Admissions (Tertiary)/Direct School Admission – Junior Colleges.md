## Direct School Admission – Junior Colleges


#### WHAT IS DSA-JC?

DSA-JC is an admission exercise to allow JCs/Institutions to select some Secondary 4/5 students for admission to JC1 based on their achievements and talents before the GCE ‘O’ Level examination results are released.

### WHY DO WE HAVE DSA-JC?

The DSA-JC is to provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a JC/Institution.

### WHEN IS DSA-JC CONDUCTED?

The 2015 DSA-JC Exercise will be conducted in 2 phases from **29 June 2015 to 26 Aug 2015**.
