### Press Release

Students interested in applying for direct school admission to secondary schools and Junior Colleges (JCs) for admission in 2017 may do so from May 2016. Application for early admission to polytechnics will start in June 2016.

#### DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION-SECONDARY (DSA-SEC) AND DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION-JUNIOR COLLEGE (JC) EXERCISES

2. There are 118 schools participating in the 2016 DSA-Sec Exercise. Information on the secondary schools and their distinctive programmes can be found [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/direct-admissions/dsa-sec/participating-schools). The 22 JCs participating in the DSA-JC Exercise this year can be found [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/direct-admissions/dsa-jc/participating-schools). Interested students should visit the relevant school’s website for more information on the application period and procedures.

3. Students will be selected for admission to secondary school or JC before their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) or GCE O-Level examination results are released. Students participating in the DSA-Sec or DSA-JC Exercise are still required to take the PSLE or GCE O-Level examination respectively. Students who take up a DSA-Sec Confirmed Offer are guaranteed a place in the school or institution, provided their PSLE examination results meet the minimum requirement for a course \[Express/ Normal (Academic)/ Normal (Technical)\] offered by the school. For students who take up a DSA-JC Offer, their GCE O-Level examination results must meet the eligibility criteria for admission to a JC.

4. Students who are successfully admitted to a school via the DSA-Sec or DSA-JC Exercise will not be able to participate in the Secondary One Posting Exercise or the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) respectively. They will also not be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of their results. Students are expected to honour the commitment to the posted DSA school for the duration of the programme they are admitted for. The timelines for the 2016 [DSA-Sec](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/admissions/dsa-sec/files/dsa-sec-phases.pdf) and [DSA-JC](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/admissions/dsa-jc/files/dsa-jc-phases.pdf) Exercises can be accessed via the respective websites.

#### EARLY ADMISSIONS EXERCISE (EAE) FOR POLYTECHNICS

5. The Direct Polytechnic Admission (DPA) Exercise will be replaced by the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) from this year onwards. The Joint Polytechnic Special Admissions Exercise (JPSAE) will also be folded into the EAE. All [five polytechnics](https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/direct-admissions/eae) are participating in the EAE.

6. Through the EAE, students can apply for admission based on their aptitudes and interests in the specific courses that they have applied for. Students with exceptional talents in areas such as leadership, community service, sports and arts may also be considered through the EAE.

7. Successful applicants under EAE will be given a conditional offer before taking their GCE O-Level examination. However, they must meet the baseline admissions criteria of a net aggregate ELR2B2 score of 26 points or better and Minimum Entry Requirements for admission to their specific polytechnic courses. The timeline for 2016 EAE can be found at [https://eae.polytechnic.edu.sg/](https://eae.polytechnic.edu.sg/).

8. Students who have accepted a place via EAE will not be eligible to participate in the JAE. They will also not be able to transfer to another course after the release of the GCE O-Level examination results. Students are expected to honour the commitment to the polytechnic courses.

#### 

The Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise aims to promote holistic education by giving participating schools greater flexibility in selecting students while holding to the key principles of transparency and meritocracy. For students, the DSA provides them the opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of student achievements and talents in seeking admission at the pre-university level.

### [EARLY ADMISSIONS EXERCISE](https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/direct-admissions/eae) - POLYTECHNICS

#### 

The Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) allows students to apply for admission to polytechnic based on their interests and aptitudes, and secure a place in a polytechnic diploma course prior to their GCE O-Level examinations. It allows the polytechnics greater flexibility to select students on a broader measure of aptitude beyond just academic grades, thus allowing a wider range of talents to be recognised.
