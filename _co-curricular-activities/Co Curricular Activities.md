## Co-Curricular Activities 

### Role of CCAs


CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation.  
  

Every Saint must take part in one CCA from the following options:

*   Clubs and Societies
    
*   Physical Sports
    
*   Uniformed Groups
    
*   Visual and Performing Arts Group
