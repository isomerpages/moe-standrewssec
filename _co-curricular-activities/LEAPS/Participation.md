### Definition and Application of the Term 'Exemplary Conduct and Active Contribution'

Schools have the autonomy to define and apply the term 'exemplary conduct and active contribution' with respect to their school's context. This provision is applicable to Levels 3 to 5 of the Participation domain and allows schools to recognise the exemplary conduct and active contribution of a student to his/her CCA over the 3, 4 or 5 years of participation in their CCA respectively. 

It also provides an opportunity for a student who may not have been regular in attendance in certain years to have a second chance to work towards a good co-curricular experience. Students should not misconstrue that CCA is unimportant and use this provision as an excuse to skip CCA sessions. 

If, for example, a student demonstrates exemplary conduct and contributes actively to his/her CCA for the first 3 or 4 years of secondary school respectively, but decides to absent himself/herself and not contribute in his/her graduating year, such behaviour is not considered exemplary and hence, the student should not be recognised using this criteria.
