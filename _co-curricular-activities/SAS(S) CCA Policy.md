<h2>CCA Policy at St Andrew's</h2>
<p>Students must have a main CCA each year from one of the 4 groups.&nbsp;The
attendance rate for participation will be based on the attendance of the
main CCA.</p>
<p>Students are highly encouraged to participate and achieve excellence in
only one CCA.</p>
<p>Students who are keen to experience different CCAs offered in school may
opt for the change at the beginning of each academic year. (Sec 1s and
2s only).</p>
<p>In such cases, the points awarded for the previous CCA would be credited
to the students’ CCA records. However, the student must fulfil a minimum
of 75% CCA attendance for that year.</p>
<p>However, this does not apply to students in the mandatory CCA.</p>
<h2>CCA Participation</h2>
<p>CCA participation is compulsory in Secondary School.</p>
<p>Schools are to be guided by the Co-Curriculum philosophy and principles
as well as the purpose of CCA when planning and implementing CCA programmes
to achieve the learning outcomes.&nbsp;
<br>The selection of CCA programmes offered should be consistent with the
school’s mission and appeal to the diverse interests of students. It should
also take into consideration available manpower and material resources.</p>
<h2>CCA Student Development Plan</h2>
<p>Each CCA should be guided by a CCA Student Development Plan (SDP). The
SDP should design the CCA experience towards progressive development and
attainment of CCA learning outcomes as students move from one level to
the next. The CCA SDP should provide students with an all year involvement
in CCA.&nbsp;
<br>Provision should be made for all students to be exposed to the basics
of the CCA, with the more advanced students supported to excel and develop
their talents. A variety of programmes and activities should be offered
to provide for holistic development and to broaden students' learning.&nbsp;
<br>Each CCA is encouraged to incorporate CCA-based Values in Action (VIA)
activities or projects which are teacher-led or student-initiated in their
planning of activities for the year.</p>
<h2>CCA Hours</h2>
<p>The recommended average hours for secondary school and pre-university
level are 5-6 hours per week per CCA. Schools have the autonomy to vary
the hours within reasonable limits to cater to their students’ age-group,
abilities, interests, talents and well-being.&nbsp;
<br>CCA hours may vary during competition periods and off season periods.</p>
<h2>Broadening CCA experiences</h2>
<p>Students may choose to participate in more than one CCA in order to broaden
their experiences and learn a wider range of skills. However we encourage
all students to participate and achieve in one CCA.</p>
<p>Student-initiated activities
<br>Students who are keen on an activity not offered in the school can be
encouraged to start a Student Initiated Activity (SiA) by gathering peers
who have a similar interest in the activity and obtaining the school’s
endorsement of the activity.</p>
<p>SiAs which prove to be well-structured and sustainable could be developed
into a new CCA with the school’s approval. As with all CCA, SiAs should
be geared towards teaching a skill related to the activity, and at the
same time cultivate desirable values, dispositions and competencies in
line with the purpose of and learning outcomes of CCA.</p>
<p>Participation in National Youth Squad with the National Sports Association</p>
<p>Students may pursue a sustained programme with a National Sports Association.
Such involvement should not replace the need for participation in a school-based
CCA.&nbsp;
<br>The relevant organisation may seek the school principal's permission for
the students to be exempted from the school's CCA training sessions. Once
the training stint with the organisation ends, the students will have to
resume training with the school’s CCA.</p>
<h2>Change of CCA</h2>
<p>Students who are keen to experience a different CCA offered in school
may opt for a change at the&nbsp;<strong>beginning of each academic year</strong>.
In such cases, the number of years of participation in the previous CCA
can be credited to the student's new CCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In St Andrew's School (Secondary), the CCA transfer window will be the whole of term 1.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>If any students want to change their CCAs in other terms, it will be done on case by case basis.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Change of CCA is applicable for lower secondary only.</strong>
</p>
<p>Continuous involvement in and commitment to the same CCA will be rewarded,
and this is reflected through a higher level of attainment assigned to
students who stay with the same CCA over the years. Continuous and regular
participation in a CCA throughout the secondary school years is fundamental
to contributing to the quality of school life and overall student development
with the students deepening their knowledge and skills in a particular
area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There could be several exceptional and valid reasons that may affect the
continual participation of a student in his/her CCA, through no fault of
the student. These include:</p>
<p><strong>(i)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>medical concerns;</strong>
</p>
<p>If a student is required to change his/her CCA due to medical reasons,
the student will be considered as having been in the same CCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if a student in a Physical Sports CCA sustains an injury
and is hence unable to continue in the CCA, the student will be considered
as having been in the same CCA, even though he/she switches to a new CCA
that replaces the original Physical Sports CCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(ii)</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>the closure of a CCA;</strong>
</p>
<p>If a student is required to change his/her CCA due to the closure of their
CCA (for reasons that are not within their control, such as school-based
decisions), the student will be considered as having been in the same CCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(iii)</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>no corresponding CCA for transfer students in their new school.</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition, if a student transfers to another secondary school which
does not offer the CCA that he/she belonged to in his/her previous school,
the student will be considered as having been in the same CCA. The same
would apply if the student does not meet the criteria in the new school
to join the CCA that he/she belonged to in his/her previous school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, if the student comes from an overseas school that does not
have co-curricular activities, the student will be considered as having
been in the same CCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if a student transfers to another secondary school which offers
the CCA that he/she belonged to in his/her previous school but the student
chooses to participate in a different CCA in the new school, the student
will not be considered as having been in the same CCA.</p>
<p><strong>In such cases, the student would be considered as having been in the&nbsp;same&nbsp;CCA.</strong>
