<h2>Infocomm Technology Club</h2>
<p>The Infocomm Technology Club, introduced under a new structure from 2026,
provides students with opportunities to develop foundational and applied
skills in information and communication technology through structured,
hands-on learning experiences. The club supports the development of relevant
digital competencies and 21st-century skills aligned with real-world applications
and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>From 2026, the club will be organised into two strands:</p>
<p><strong>Coding and Programming (formerly Saints Media)<br></strong>This
strand serves as a common core for all members. Students are introduced
to computational thinking and fundamental coding concepts, before progressing
to applied areas such as app development, game design, graphic design,
and artificial intelligence. Learning experiences are designed to foster
logical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p><strong>Robotics and Engineering (formerly Robotics)<br></strong> This
strand focuses on applied learning through the design, construction, and
programming of robots using platforms such as LEGO Education SPIKE Prime.
Students develop coding, engineering, and analytical skills through structured
tasks and challenge-based activities. <em>There will be no new Secondary 1 intake for this strand from 2026.</em>
</p>
<p>Through participation in training sessions, workshops, and competitions,
members develop both technical competencies and essential soft skills,
including teamwork, communication, and project management. The Infocomm
Technology Club supports students in becoming confident, responsible, and
adaptable users of technology.</p>
