#### **Introduction to Direct School Admission for Secondary Schools (DSA-Sec)**

The Direct School Admission for Secondary Schools (DSA-Sec), introduced in 2004, allows students to seek admission to a secondary school on the basis of a diverse range academic and non- academic talents and achievements that may not be demonstrated at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).

If the child is admitted to a secondary school through DSA-Sec, they are not allowed to:

•Submit school choices during the Secondary 1 (S1) posting process.

•Transfer to another school. They must commit to their chosen school for the duration of the programme.
