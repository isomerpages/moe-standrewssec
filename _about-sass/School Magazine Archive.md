School magazines from 1950 to 2015 are available in PDF versions in Google Drive: [link here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hdgKzkadWy\8ASGBSBMKWGGBxFQgSWSqT?usp=share_link). Hard copies are also available in school for browsing. Interested readers may write in to the General Office (sass@moe.edu.sg) to make the request.

Due to regulations under [Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/overview-of-pdpa/the-legislation/personal-data-protection-act), school magazines from 2016 to 2022 are not available for download.
