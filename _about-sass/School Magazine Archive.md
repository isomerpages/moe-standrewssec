We regrest to inform that due to the migration of the School Website, the new host platform is unable to service the large volume of archives. 

School magazines from 1950 to 2015 are available in PDF versions. Hard copies are also available in school for browsing. Interested readers may write in to the General Office (sass@moe.edu.sg) to make the request.

Due to regulations under [Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/overview-of-pdpa/the-legislation/personal-data-protection-act), school magazines from 2016 to 2022 are not available for download. 

From 2023, the school magazine will come in the form of animated media. 

The School will continue to explore other possible methods for easy access to the school magazines between 1950 to 2015, and we welcome your suggestions.

We thank you for your support and patience.
