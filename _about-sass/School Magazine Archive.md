School magazines from 1950 to 2015 are available for download. Due to regulations under [Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/overview-of-pdpa/the-legislation/personal-data-protection-act), school magazines from 2016 to 2022 are not available for download. 

Hard copies are available in school for browsing. Interested readers may write in to the General Office (sass@moe.edu.sg) to make the request.

From 2023, the school magazine will come in the form of animated media. 

Due to the large volume of archives, the school magazines will be uploaded in batches on our website in the coming months. We thank you for your patience. For urgent browsing, please feel free to email us for assistance.
