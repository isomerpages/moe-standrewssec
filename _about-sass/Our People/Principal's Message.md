Welcome to the Saints Family!

St Andrew’s School was founded in 1862 by the Anglican Diocese of Singapore. Since&nbsp;2004, the Secondary School has been sited together with its affiliated Junior School and Junior College in St&nbsp;Andrew’s Village. Blessed with a proud heritage and with the strong support of the church, alumni&nbsp;members and parents, the school has grown from strength to strength. It is indeed an honour to be leading the school, as a Saint myself.&nbsp;

A well-established school, St Andrew’s School (Secondary) provides a holistic education for our boys to&nbsp;build character and develop life skills and competencies to navigate life in the 21st Century.&nbsp;Servant leadership is a trait entrenched in the school’s origins, dating back to its founding to cater to&nbsp;the needs of impoverished Chinese boys. Following this tradition, the school’s vision is to nurture servant&nbsp;leaders who bring life to the nations.

In recognition of each individual’s varied strengths, the learning goals in St Andrew’s aim to develop boys to become men of exemplary character, whilst arming them with soft skills to be Skilled Communicators, Community Builders and Holistic Thinkers. To hone these skills, the school designs a wide range of programmes that empower our Saints and cultivate in them a strong sense of purpose and passion to serve the school, community and nation.&nbsp;

The school offers customised programmes and pedagogical approaches catering to students’ varied interests and strengths, to help them develop strength of character, a strong learning disposition and 21st century skills and competencies. Our Applied Learning Programme on Engineering Design equips Saints with problem solving skills using Critical Thinking and the Design Thinking framework. Saints get to identify themselves as engineers and are inspired to creatively design solutions to authentic issues. This encourages discovery, exploratory learning and problem solving that will enable them to make sense of the world and better prepare for the future.&nbsp;

Our Learning for Life Programme on Community &amp; Youth Leadership aims to cultivate confident leaders among our boys who actively contribute to their communities. Aligned with the school's vision of being a "Home of servant leaders who bring life to the nations," our program emphasizes the servant leadership model. The desired outcomes include empowering boys to lead themselves and others with confidence while making meaningful contributions to their communities through their leadership skills and dispositions.

In pursuit of their aspirations, Saints embark on an enriching and rewarding educational journey as they mature into servant leaders who are prepared to tackle challenges. I have many fond memories of my time in SA and I believe that our boys will enjoy the same Saints experience.&nbsp;

We thank God for His grace, wisdom and blessings as we continue our work together as One Family Unbroken to grow our staff and boys.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Every boy is precious. We shall do our best to love them unconditionally and nurture them to be gentlemen of wisdom and stature!

Up and On!&nbsp;

Regards,

**Mr Lee Han Hwa**
