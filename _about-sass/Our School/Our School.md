St Andrew’s School was the first Anglican school for boys to be founded in Singapore in 1862 by Rev Edward Sherman Venn. The humble, small, semi-private institution has gone from strength to strength ever since.   

Our school has moved 5 times to better provide for the growing number of students we serve. The most significant would be the move to our current premises in 2006, which has brought all the schools in the St Andrew’s family under one roof at St Andrew’s Village (SAV). Since then, campus enhancements include the construction of a swimming pool, artificial grass pitch for rugby and artificial turf for hockey. To support the growth of our athletes, we also have an in-house physiotherapy clinic and gym. As of 2019, the school boasts an Indoor Sports Hall double the capacity of a regular hall, to cater to the schools in the SAV.   

Likewise, our curriculum and activities have been developed and refined to bring out the best in our boys. They include customised courses and approaches: tailored to students’ learning needs and preferences in the various streams. Leveraging on our location by the Kallang River, one of our key programmes – River Studies – supports learning beyond the classroom and authentically teaches the importance of environmental conservation.   

St Andrew’s School has a long tradition of achievement and excellence in sports. In 2004, we were recognised as a rugby niche school. In view of the school’s sound sports programme, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP): Sports for Life in 2014. The programme inculcates life skills and values in our boys to serve society while encouraging them to lead an active lifestyle. The following year, in 2015, the school was accorded Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in engineering and robotics. Through ALP, our boys apply logical reasoning and design thinking in their projects, and sharpen their critical and creative thinking abilities in the process.   

The arts has always been an integral part of the Saints’ experience. The school introduces programmes to excite and engage our students in developing their appreciation towards the arts, such as via the annual Arts and Design Festival, Performing Arts concerts and Hall Assembly programmes.   

At St Andrew’s, we offer a holistic education that nurtures all-rounded Saints: Servant Leaders who bring life to the nations.
