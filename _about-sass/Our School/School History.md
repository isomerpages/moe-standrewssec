As a result of the sermon on Whitsunday 1856 by Rev Humphreys, a group of laymen formed themselves into a committee for the spreading of the Gospel in the then 37-year old Singapore.<br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"></td></tr><tr style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"><td style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 15px 15px 0px; vertical-align: top; border: none;"><h4 style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(184, 138, 45); font-size: 1.2em; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-weight: 700;">1860s</h4></td><td style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 15px 15px 0px; vertical-align: top; border: none;">One of the steps taken was to seek a missionary and this resulted in the arrival of the Rev Edward Sherman Venn in 1861. The private institution of Chin Chew Street had no connection with the Anglican Church at that time - this was only brought about on 8 September 1862 when it was adopted by the Anglican Church because of the work and influence of Venn. Thus St. Andrew's School was founded on 8 September 1862 by Venn.<br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;">One year later, on 10 September 1863, the School moved to Upper Hokkien Street because of the need for a better building and more space for the growing School. Soon after, Mr Cheok Loy Fatt was appointed the Headmaster and he proved to be the excellent choice.<br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;">For some years, the mission had serious financial difficulties, resulting in their withdrawing its financial support for the School in 1866. The School suffered an even greater loss with the passing away of her Founder and friend. In spite of these losses, Loy Fatt carried on managing the School by himself.</td></tr></tbody></table>
