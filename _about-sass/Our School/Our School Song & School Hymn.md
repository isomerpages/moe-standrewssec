    <td>Lives are in the making here,  
Hearts are in the waking here,  
Mighty undertaking here,  
Up and On!  
We are arming for the fight,  
Pressing on with all our might,  
Pluming wings for higher flight,  
Up and On!  
			
(CHORUS)</td>
		<td>Fair before us lies the way,  
Time for work and time for play;  
Fill the measure while we may,  
Up and On!  
Life and time will not delay,  
Time is running fast away,  
Life is now today; today;  
Up and On!  
  
(CHORUS)</td>
		<td>Foes in plenty we shall meet,  
Hearts courageous scorn defeat;  
So we press with eager feet,  
Up and On!  
Ever onward to the fight,  
Ever upward to the Light,  
Ever true to GOD and RIGHT,  
Up and On!  
  
(CHORUS)</td>

**CHORUS**

Up Boys! Truest fame  
Lies in high endeavour;  
Play the game! Keep the flame  
Burning brightly ever!

### School Hymn
![](/images/hymn.jpg)

Our Father, by whose servants,  
Our School was built of old,  
Whose hand has crowned Thy children,  
With blessings manifold;  
For Thine unfailing mercies,  
Far strewn along our way,  
With all who passed before us,  
We praise Thy name today.  
  
They reaped not where they laboured,  
We reap what they have sown;  
Our harvest may be garnered,  
By ages yet unknown.  
The days of old have dowered us  
With gifts beyond all praise,  
Our Father make us faithful  
To serve the coming days.  
  
Before us and beside us,  
Still holden by Thy hand,  
A cloud of unseen witness,  
Our elder comrades stand;  
One family unbroken,  
We join with one acclaim;  
One heart, one voice uplifting  
To glorify Thy Name.
